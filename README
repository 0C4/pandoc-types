pandoc-types contains definitions for the Pandoc data structure,
which is used by [pandoc] (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc) to represent
structured documents.

Starting with pandoc 1.7, these definitions have been put in a separate
package, so that other packages can use them without drawing in all of pandoc's
dependencies, and so that pandoc can depend on packages (like citeproc-hs)
that use them.

A builder module, which makes it easy to generate Pandoc structures
programmatically, has also been provided.
