pandoc-types contains definitions for the Pandoc data structure,
which is used by [pandoc] (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc) to represent
structured documents.

These definitions have been put in a separate package so that other
packages can use them without drawing in all of pandoc's dependencies.

A builder module, which makes it easy to generate Pandoc structures
programmatically, is also provided.
